# Racket-Project

This project is based on the maths portion of the popular TV show - Countdown. Written in Racket this project will generate a random three digit number (101 -999) and will also pick up to 6 other numbers (consisting of 4 smaller numbers and 2 big numbers - 25, 50, 75 an 100, everything else is considered small for this purpose). Then a function will be used to decide if this sum if solvable (telling the person if it's not solvable) by giving an exact answer for an answer somewhere close to the number given. The project will be made using the Dr. Racket IDE.
